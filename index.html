            <p>My Name is Tysheba L. Morgan.  I was born on December 13th, 1974 in Cleveland, Ohio. My parents are Tyrone Morgan and Frances Elizabeth Gregley.  I am the third child of six - four girls and two boys. </p>
            <p>I graduated from Howard Univerty with a Masters in Finance.  I've always loved to work with numbers. I was good in math as a child so I studied accounting and finance in school.  I have the following certifications:</p>
           
            <p>Just recently I started to realize I have a love for programming and fashion. I know the two don't mix.  I really started to appreciate technology and what programming can do while working in the finance and accounting profession. 
                In all the corporate jobs I have had, my proudest accomplishments are those where I used technology to make processes simpler and more efficient.  
                Whether I created a nice Excel Spreadsheet with impressive macros, an Access Database program, or worked with an in-house geek to create a custom program; I have enjoyed the process of creating something.  
               </p>
            <p>On the fashion side - I am the co-owner of a boutique called Charm City Boutique located in the University area of Charlotte, North Carolina. My boyfriend and I love to buy clothes from all over the world,
                put outfits together, and sell them.  We also love being entrepenuers.  Our goal is to retire young and rich.
